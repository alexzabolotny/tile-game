# Tile game

## Tech
    * Built with use of [Jaws](http://jawsjs.com) library;
    * Tested to work Mac OS (10.8.3) and iOS.

## Objective
    * Click tiles to open;
    * Match pairs of tiles to eliminate them;
    * See your score at the end.

## Plans
    * Add some nice textures to the background and tiles;
    * Allow users to progress by generating
    * Game sounds (Jaws doesn't support them out of the box);
    * Scoreboard;
    * Compete online.

## Appendix
    * Background texture is from <http://www.plaintextures.com/>;
    * You can use and change parts of this project with respect of their original license.
